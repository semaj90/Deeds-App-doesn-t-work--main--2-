## Tests Performed

### 1. 🗂️ Directory Structure Validation

- **✅ PASS**: Models directory exists at `src-tauri/llm-models/`
- **✅ PASS**: Proper directory permissions for file operations

### 2. 📤 File Upload Simulation
- **✅ PASS**: Created test model files (txt, gguf formats)
- **✅ PASS**: File copy operations to upload directory
- **✅ PASS**: File size verification (79 bytes and 55 bytes)
- **✅ PASS**: Multiple file format support

### 3. 🔒 Security Validation
- **✅ PASS**: File extension validation (.txt, .gguf, .bin, .safetensors, .pt, .pth)
- **✅ PASS**: Path traversal attack prevention (no `../`, `/`, `\` in filenames)
- **✅ PASS**: File name sanitization
- **✅ PASS**: Directory boundary enforcement

### 4. 🤖 Model Listing Functionality
- **✅ PASS**: Created test model directories (llama-test, gemma-test)
- **✅ PASS**: Model directory enumeration works correctly
- **✅ PASS**: Model metadata creation and storage

### 5. 🌐 Browser Integration
- **✅ PASS**: LLM upload test dashboard accessible at http://localhost:5175/llm-upload-test.html
- **✅ PASS**: SvelteKit dev server running on port 5175
- **✅ PASS**: Browser-based file selection and drag-drop interface
- **✅ PASS**: Real-time upload progress display
- **✅ PASS**: Error handling and user feedback

### 6. 🖥️ Tauri Desktop Integration
- **✅ PASS**: Tauri CLI version 11.4.2 installed and functional
- **✅ PASS**: Rust backend commands registered:
  - `list_llm_models` - Lists available models
  - `upload_llm_model` - Handles file uploads
  - `run_llm_inference` - Processes model inference
- **✅ PASS**: File system access from Rust backend
- **✅ PASS**: Error handling in Tauri commands

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend (Rust/Tauri)
```rust
// Key functions implemented:
- list_models() -> Lists model directories
- upload_model() -> Handles file uploads with validation
- run_inference() -> Processes model queries
```

### Frontend (Browser)
```javascript
// Key features:
- Drag & drop file upload interface
- Real-time progress feedback
- Model selection and testing
- Error handling and validation
```

### File Upload Process
1. **File Selection**: User selects/drops model files
2. **Validation**: Extension and name security checks
3. **Upload**: File transfer to `llm-uploads/` directory
4. **Verification**: Size and integrity validation
5. **Listing**: Updated model list display
