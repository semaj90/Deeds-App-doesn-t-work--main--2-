# Local LLM Integration with Rust (Tauri) for SvelteKit

This guide explains how to set up, organize, and use local Large Language Models (LLMs) with your SvelteKit app, using a Rust (Tauri) backend for secure, high-performance inference.

---

## Directory Structure

Your project should be organized as follows:

```
web-app/
  sveltekit-frontend/         # SvelteKit frontend (UI, API routes)
  src-tauri/                  # Tauri Rust backend
    llm-models/               # <--- Place your local LLM files here
      gemma/
        model.bin
        config.json
      llama/
        model.bin
        config.json
    llm-uploads/              # (Optional) For user-uploaded models
      ...
```

- **llm-models/**: Store all pre-installed/downloaded LLMs here (e.g., Gemma, Llama, etc.).
- **llm-uploads/**: (Optional) For user-uploaded models, if you want to allow uploads via the app.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Model Storage
- All LLM files are stored in `src-tauri/llm-models/` (or `llm-uploads/` for uploads).
- The SvelteKit frontend never directly accesses these files; only the Rust backend does.

### 2. Inference Flow
- The SvelteKit frontend sends chat or inference requests to an API endpoint (e.g., `/api/llm/chat`).
- The orchestrator (Node/SvelteKit) calls the Tauri backend (Rust) to run inference with the selected model.
- The Rust backend loads the model from `llm-models/` or `llm-uploads/`, runs inference, and returns the result.
- The orchestrator returns the response to the frontend.

### 3. Uploading Models (Optional)
- If you want to allow users to upload models, implement a file upload endpoint in the Tauri backend that saves files to `llm-uploads/`.
- Always validate uploaded files (size, type) and restrict access for security.

## Example: Rust (Tauri) Model Listing

```rust
// src-tauri/src/llm.rs
use std::path::PathBuf;

pub fn list_models() -> Vec<String> {
    let mut models = vec![];
    let base = PathBuf::from("llm-models");
    if let Ok(entries) = std::fs::read_dir(base) {
        for entry in entries.flatten() {
            if entry.path().is_dir() {
                models.push(entry.file_name().to_string_lossy().to_string());
            }
        }
    }
    models
}
// Add functions to load a model and run inference...
```

---

## Security & Best Practices
- Only allow trusted users to upload models.
- Validate uploaded files (size, type).
- Never expose model files to the public web.
- Keep all LLM files on the backend (never in the frontend directory).

---

## Summary
- Place your LLMs in `src-tauri/llm-models/`.
- (Optional) Allow uploads to `src-tauri/llm-uploads/`.
- The Rust backend (Tauri) handles all model access and inference.
- The SvelteKit frontend communicates with the backend via API endpoints.

---

## Next Steps
1. Create the `llm-models/` and (optionally) `llm-uploads/` directories inside `src-tauri/`.
2. Place your LLM files in the appropriate directory.
3. Implement or update your Rust backend to load and use these models for inference.
4. Connect your SvelteKit frontend to the backend via API endpoints.
